Project Idea Prompts
====================

Utensil/Tool Design for People with Parkinson's Disease
-------------------------------------------------------

Parkinson's disease often causes uncontrollable shaking. This prevents people
with the disease from performing many daily tasks. For example, it is difficult
to eat with utensils because the vibration in the hand causes the food to fall
from the utensil or not make it into the mouth. There are products that damp
the vibrations in the utensil, for example the `Liftware Steady Spoon`_. The
goal of this project would be to design a utensil or tool that could allow
those with Parkinson's to continue the task.

You will need to characterize the typical motion and vibrations that occur in
the task. The task should be one that can be modeled with a planar model of the
arm, hand, and utensil/tool. The idea woudl be do design a passive mechanism
with appropriate damping that causes the effector of the utensil to move more
smoothly.

Record Player Needle
--------------------

Record players produce sound by vibrating a thin structure, the needle, across
a dimpled surface. The vibration of the needle then has to be transformed into
vibrations of the air to produce sound. The simplest setup can be created by
attaching a vibrating needle to a paper cone that amplifies the air vibration
magnitude. Electronic record players use a voice coil that transforms
mechanical motion into voltage changes in a coil via the Lorentz effect which
is the amplified via the transformation back into the motion of the speaker
diaphram. This project could explore the design geometry of the needle, the
surface shapes of the record dimpliing, the tranformation into electric energy,
fatigue constraints, material selection, or resonance.

Cricket Sound Production
------------------------

Cricket's and other bugs produce sound by vibrating elements of their
exoskeletons. This project woudl involve investing the geometric and material
properties of the exoskeleton elements that are used to make their chirp,
creating a simple model of the mechanism, and designing the model to produce
chirps of appropriate frequency and amplitude.

Braking On Cobblestone
----------------------

A cobblestone road is shaped such that a tire (e.g. bicycle tire) doesn't have
a 

Car, Motorcycle, etc. Traversing Periodic Roads

TODO

Bus Seat
--------

The driver's seat of buses are typically mounted on special suspension systems
that have large travel. This project could investigate why this is the only
seat with suspension, how should this suspension be designed, data collection
of acceleration of different locations on a bus.

Tuned Mass Damper
-----------------

Tuned mass dampers are often designed and installed in skyscapers to damp
oscillations due to earthquakes. This project would focus on modeling a
multistory building and designing a tune mass damper to

Piezoelectric Hydraulic Pump
--------------------------------------

Piezoelectric materials are those which convert applied mechanical stress into electrical signals. These materials are used in a wide array of transducers (sensors and actuators).

In this project, you will model a positive displacement piston pump powered by a piezoelectric stack actuator. The piezoelectric actuator will be driven by a sinusoidal voltage at a frequency of approximately 1kHz. The pump will consist of a single piston moving axially in a frictionless bore. Your simulation will include the mass and stiffness of the pump housing, piston, and fluid, as well as pressure losses from flow resistance. This study will examine how elements of mechanical design are driven by the properties and limitations of real materials. An effective model will aid in the identification of design criteria that will drive the selection of materials, and the geometry of the final product.
