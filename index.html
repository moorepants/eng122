<p>Mechanical structures and systems are susceptible to vibrations, i.e. periodic
changes in the physical state. Vibrations can both be a hindrance and a benefit
to machines. In this course, we will learn how one can predict vibrations and
interpret both simulated and measured vibrations using analytical and
computational means. We will cover topics ranging from free and forced
vibrations in lumped-parameter systems with and without damping, vibrations in
coupled systems, electromechanical analogs, and use of energy conservation
principles.</p>
<div class="section" id="catalog-description">
<h3>Catalog Description</h3>
<blockquote>
Lecture—4 hours. Prerequisite: C- or better in Engineering 102; C- or better
in Engineering 6 or course 5 or Computer Science Engineering 30; ability to
program in MATLAB. Free and forced vibrations in lumped-parameter systems
with and without damping; vibrations in coupled systems; electromechanical
analogs; use of energy conservation principles. GE credit: SciEng | QL,
SE.—F. (F.)</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>There are three broad learning objectives that we focus on in the course:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Students will be able to analyze vibrational measurement data to draw
conclusions about the measured system's vibrational nature and describe how
the system behaves with respect to vibration concepts.</li>
<li>Students will be able to create simple mathematical and computational models
of real vibrating systems that can be used to answer specific questions
about the system by concisely demonstrating the vibrational phenomena.</li>
<li>Students will be able to design a mechanical system that has desirable
vibrational behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students that master these three core learning objectives will be well prepared
to use mechanical vibration concepts, theories, and tools to solve engineering
problems.</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution and presentation of the work. Keep in
mind that actually doing all of the homework yourself is critical for learning
and passing the course.</p>
<p>You may discuss your projects with others but the presented text, code,
figures, and other materials in the reports must be created solely by yourself.</p>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>There is no assigned textbook for the course but you may want to obtain a
mechanical vibrations textbook for reference. There are numerous books on the
subject that all present essentially the same materials. Here are some options:</p>

<dt>Classwork</dt>
<dd>There will be a large number of in class computational exercises. These will
be graded for participation and/or correctness. You may have to finish the
activities we started in class outside of class and submit with your
homework that week.</dd>
<dt>Homework</dt>
<dd>Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
following week.</dd>
<dt>Project</dt>
<dd>You will select a course project from a set of options provided by the
instructors or one that you choose yourself. Approximately, midway through
you will turn in a midterm report detailing a model that you develop for
your system. At the end of the course, you will submit a report and give a 5
minute lightning talk during the scheduled exam period detailing the
modeling, analysis, and design aspects of your project.</dd>

<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h2>Canvas</h2>
<p>We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select <strong>ENG 122 001 WQ 2020</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be using several features in canvas:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Announcements</dt>
<dd>This will be the instructors' primary communication avenue to you. These
announcements will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You
are expected to read these either through your email program or on the
Canvas website.</dd>
<dt>Assignments</dt>
<dd>The electronic assignments will be listed here but will be distributed and
collected through the JuyterHub.</dd>
<dt>Discussions</dt>
<dd>Canvas discussions should be used for all questions about the class,
homework, theory, projects, etc that is not of a private nature. Discussions
allows both the instructors and students to collectively answer questions
for the whole classes benefit. When considering contacting the instructors
via email you should default to submitting it via Discussions unless the
question is a private matter.</dd>
<dt>Grades</dt>
<dd>Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
as the course goes along.</dd>
<dt>Files</dt>
<dd>Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
website.</dd>

<div class="section" id="accomodation">
<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<p>The primary instructor should be informed of any learning accommodations at
least 1 full week before the desired accommodation is needed. I expect students
to contact me to discuss any special arrangements with 1 week time to make and
agree on the arrangements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="computers">
<h2>Computers</h2>
<p>All of the in-class exercises will be done on a personal computing device
(preferably one with a keyboard) that you will be expected to bring to class.
If you do not have a suitable computing device that you can bring to class, you
will need to let the primary instructor know the day of the first class period.</p>
