    "So far we have learned about free vibrations of conservative single degree of freedom linear systems. In this lesson, we will explore how these systems behave when dissaptive forces are added to the system. Dissipation is present in all real systems. For example, the shock absorbers in a car dissipative energy as heat to control the characteristics of the vibration of the vehicle. Drag due to air resistance is also a dissaptive force.\n",
