    "This is a collection of notebooks designed for approximately one hour in-class sessions intended to learn mechanical vibration topics through computing. These were developed for a ten week course with two two-hour sessions each week. The notebooks are designed to have a flow in which the instructor explains a concept briefly and then students do activities in pairs or small groups to answer the exercises in the notebooks. This repeats for each exercise and any exercises not finished are turned in for homework.\n",
